/**
 * This class is the activity that is used to register an account through the Service Novigrad app.
 * The account registration process is implemented using two Firebase services: Firebase Authentication and Firebase Database.
 * Firebase Authentication will be used to store the user's login credentials.
 * Firebase Database will be used to store any extra information about the user that is not stored in Firebase Authentication.
 *
 * On the registration screen (the corresponding xml to this class), the user will input text into the designated text fields that reflect
 * the information the user must provide to register an account: the user's first name, last name, email address, and account password.
 * These four pieces of information, as well as indication by the user as to whether he or she wishes to create a Branch account or
 * a regular Customer account, must be provided before the user can register an account or even send off their information to
 * any of the two Firebase services. The activity uses methods to validate this information (that each piece of information meets
 * formatting standards required to register an account â€“ see the ValidateString class for more information) and to ensure that the user
 * has not left any of the text fields blank before the user can proceed with the registration process.
 *
 * Once the user's inputted information is validated, the account registration process via Firebase will begin.
 * The user's inputted email address and password will be stored in Firebase Authentication, alongside a unique user uId that is linked to this info.
 * THe user can now use Firebase Authentication to log into the application (as long as the next steps are successful).
 * The user's other information provided at the time of registration (first name, last name, and account type) will then be stored in
 * Firebase Database. In Firebase Database, these three pieces of information will be stored under the unique user uId that was previously generated
 * by Firebase Authentication and is currently linked to the user's email address and password in that service. The user's unique uId, as well as
 * those of other users registered into our app (their uIds are unique as well), can be found in our Firebase Database under the "Users" path.
 *
 * After all information is successfully stored in Firebase Authentication and Firebase Database, the user will be redirected to the
 * main activity/the welcome screen to start using the app.
 *
 * Returning registered users to the app can bypass this registration activity (as it is the app's launcher activity) by selecting a text prompt
 * to take them to the login activity, where they can log in using the email address and password they provided at registration and allowed to be
 * stored in Firebase Authentication.
 *
 * NOTE: While testing our registration activity in the Android Emulator, we noticed that in some random cases, it takes a fairly long
 * amount of time (40 seconds+) for the user's information to be sent to Firebase and, therefore, for this user's account to be successfully
 * registered. However, these occurrences seem to have been caused on the server-end by Firebase and not by our app.
 * In the majority of cases, the registration process only took a few seconds to complete (<=5 seconds).
 * These issues did not seem to persist when we tested our app on an Android phone and an Android tablet, which were connected to
 * two different Wifi networks.
